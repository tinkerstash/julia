* [Our Github page](https://github.com/tinkerstash/node-react-passport) with React frontend, Node backend.

# Introduction

We want to build a basic example that demonstrate the use of the following technologies:

* React for frontend.
* Node-Express for backend.
* Axios for ajax (instead of jquery).
* Passport-local for authentication.
* Postgres (instead of Mongo) for potential big joins.
* Tape, Supertest for backend unit tests.

On top of that, we use some smaller convenient libraries. For frontend, we use:

* React-Toastr for convenient display of messages.
* Bootstrap for simple styling.
* React-confirm-alert for confirm dialog in React.

For backend, we use:

* Underscore for lots of nice utilities.
* Crypto for hashing salt + password.
* Continuation-local-storage for passing req, rsp globally.
